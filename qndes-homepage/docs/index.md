-   __Zettelkasten__

    ---
    My Zettelkasten is a collection of notes on various topics that I have read about or thought about.
    Each note is a small piece of information that is connected to other notes in the collection.
    The goal of the Zettelkasten is to create a network of knowledge that can be easily navigated and expanded upon.

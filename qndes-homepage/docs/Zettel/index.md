# Zettelkasten

This is my Zettelkasten, a collection of notes on various topics that I have read about or thought about. Each note is a small piece of information that is connected to other notes in the collection. The goal of the Zettelkasten is to create a network of knowledge that can be easily navigated and expanded upon.

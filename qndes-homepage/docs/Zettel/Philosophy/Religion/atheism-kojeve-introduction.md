# What did I read?

I read the introduction to `Atheism` by Alexandre Kojève.
`Atheism` a collection of his notes and reflections on religion and atheism.

# Why did I read it?

I'm interested in a good philosophical discussion of atheism and religion where the differnces between various positions are made clear.
Kojève's apparent position is very similar to my own that religion and ahteism are not very different.

# What did I learn?

- Religion and atheism assume both that there is a self and a not self. 
- The difference is that religion posits the existence of a third entity, the not-not self whereas atheism denies it.
- In russian interestingly the word for something is нечто (néch-to) and for nothing is ничто (nitch-to) which is very close.

# What do I think about it?

I think the atheist position as I understand it from the introduction (which is not form kojeve directly but from secondary sources) is very weak.
It's almost like the atheist is just a skeptic which has the the same parts given as the religious person but denies the existence of the not-not self although if there is a self and a not self the not-not self is already given as the difference/context between the two.
I have to read more of kojeve to see if he addresses this.

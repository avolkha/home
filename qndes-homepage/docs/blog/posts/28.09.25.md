During my studies I never managed to take a proper course on general relativity. 
There were a lot of references in many places, but I never got the full picture.
Recently, I cought a bad cold and had to stay in bed for a couple of days and starting to watch the MIT lectures on GR from 2020 after being bored watching series (I can recommend those, very well explained).
I've made it until lecture 6 or 7 and learned (or re-learned/remembered) already quite a lot which I was missing. 
<!-- more -->

First things I've learned/remembered actually concerned special relativity:

- Resting bodies are "flowing" through time (of course they are not flowing at all - this is just an analogy also in everything which follows below.)
- For moving observers such bodies are "flowing" through space as well
- The "total flux" must be constant for all observers (only valid in special relativity)
- This means that the time of the "resting" body must be passing slower for the moving observer, because there is less "flux" in time direction from it's point of view

Second concerns a nice little thought experiment which explains why there must be a gravitational red shift:

- Suppose you are on top of a tower dropping a rock
- At the bottom of the tower sits a device that turns the entire rock into energy and sends it back up
- When the photon arrives at the top of the tower, you collect it and turn it back into a rock
- The rock will have higher mass than in the first round trip as it gained the height energy (~mgh) as energy which is then transferred into mass
- This would yield a perpetuum mobile unless there is a gravitational red shift when sending the photon back up which reduces the energy

Other important aspects:

- The "flux" of spacetime is not constant in GR (again, the flux picture here is an analogy and not an adaquate representation)
- The metric tensor represents the flux in a certain region of space time and depends on gravity

I hope I will manage to finish the series, it seem really intersting.

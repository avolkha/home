During my studies, I never managed to take a proper course on general relativity. I encountered references to it in many places, but I never quite developed a complete picture. Recently, I caught a bad cold and had to stay in bed for a couple of days. Out of boredom—after watching too many series—I started watching the MIT lectures on general relativity from 2020 (which I can highly recommend; they are very well explained).

So far, I have made it to lecture 6 or 7 and have already learned (or re-learned and remembered) quite a lot that I had previously been missing.

<!-- more -->

The first things I learned or recalled actually concerned special relativity:

- Resting bodies are “flowing” through time (of course, they are not flowing at all—this is merely an analogy, as is everything that follows).
- For moving observers, such bodies are also “flowing” through space.
- The “total flux” must be constant for all observers (this holds only in special relativity).
- This implies that, from the moving observer’s point of view, time must pass more slowly for the “resting” body, since there is less “flux” in the time direction.

The second point concerns a nice thought experiment that explains why there must be a gravitational redshift:

- Suppose you are standing on top of a tower and drop a rock.
- At the bottom of the tower, there is a device that converts the entire rock into energy and sends it back up.
- When the photon reaches the top of the tower, you collect it and convert it back into a rock.
- The rock will now have a higher mass than before, since it gained gravitational potential energy (~mgh), which has been converted into mass.
- This would result in a perpetuum mobile unless there is a gravitational redshift when the photon travels upward, reducing its energy.

Other important aspects:

- The “flux” of spacetime is not constant in general relativity (again, the flux picture is only an analogy and not an adequate representation).
- The metric tensor represents this “flux” in a given region of spacetime and depends on gravity.

I hope I will manage to finish the lecture series—it seems really interesting.

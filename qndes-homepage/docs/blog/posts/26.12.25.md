I recently continued reading Kojeve's Analysis of Zeno's paradox again and just ordered some books which where mentioned there to get a bit better into the topic of history of science.
What fascinates me a lot about this topic is that it opens up a perspective on old (ancient) problems from a modern point of view, which elucidates both what has been the view thousands of years ago and also what our current view constitutes.
One really great book in this aspect is Medieval cosmology from Pierre Duhem.
Pierre Duhem is a well renouned physicist from the beginning of the twenteeth century who also dabbled into history of science.

In this post I will look into new things I've learned from this book.

To understand what medieval physicist thought about the world one has to start with Aristotelian physics also called *Peripatetic Physisc* which I will not give a complete account of here (I also don't fully understand what this means).
This way of thinking about physics was superseded by the modern physiscs of the 16th century, but not in a way that the enlightenment claimed, in a revulutionary manner but rather step by step replacing the old theory.

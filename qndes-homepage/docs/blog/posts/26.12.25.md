I recently continued reading Kojeve's Analysis of Zeno's paradox again and just ordered some books which where mentioned there to get a bit better into the topic of history of science.
What fascinates me a lot about this topic is that it opens up a perspective on old (ancient) problems from a modern point of view, which elucidates both what has been the view thousands of years ago and also what our current view constitutes.
One really great book in this aspect is Medieval cosmology from Pierre Duhem.
Pierre Duhem is a well renouned physicist from the beginning of the twenteeth century who also dabbled into history of science.

In this post I will look into new things I've learned from this book. 
This means, if not mentioned otherwise, all what is written here is how I understand Duhem's perspective.

To understand what medieval physicist thought about the world one has to start with Aristotelian physics also called *Peripatetic Physics* which I will not give a complete account of here (I also don't fully understand what this means at the moment and this needs a seperate investigation).
This way of thinking about physics was superseded by the modern physiscs of the 16th century, but not in a way that the enlightenment claimed, in a revulutionary manner but rather step by step replacing the old theory.
This is the old prejudice about "the dark ages of science" which is still held up until today. 
Notably, it was the influence of the church which actually drove the development towards a modern physics.
Some of the Aristotelian assumptions made in his cosmology were at odds with central dogmas of the church and were therefore challanged.

One of those assumpions was that the world is infinite both in space and in time and another that an infinite amount of distinct objects is contradictory.
This is at odds with the Christian view of the immortal soul as if there would be an infinite world infinite numbers of souls would have accumulated over time which is not possible according to the second assumption.
There were several ways out of this dilemma:
- *Stoics* denied any belief in the immortality of the soul
- *Neoplatonists* believed in re-incarnation of the soul - there is a limited number of souls which get re-purposed over time.
- *Avicenna* believed that the restriction of actual infinities only concenrns objects which have an extent and a position in space. Souls would not be affected by this restriction. He still upheld the Aristotelian premise that the causal sequences still have to be finite, as there must be a first cause to explain anything. This however is at odds with the assumption of an infinite world and he reconciled this by only referring to "essential causes" which cannot be infinite, but there are auxiliary or preparatory causes. *Note from myself: This is interesting as this hints at a memorylessness which 'allows for spontaniously starting a new causal sequence' as it is also stated in Kant. It would be interesting to investigate if this is really a novel aspect in Avicenna or is already present in Aristotle.*
- *Averroes* referring to Avicenna asserted that after death all souls would be united into a common "super intelligence" as numbers are restricted to objects in space. 

*To be continued.*

I recently continued reading Kojève’s *Analysis of Zeno’s Paradox* and ordered several books mentioned there in order to deepen my understanding of the history of science. What fascinates me most about this topic is that it opens up a modern perspective on ancient problems, illuminating both how these issues were viewed thousands of years ago and how we understand them today.

One particularly valuable book in this respect is *Medieval Cosmology* by Pierre Duhem. Duhem was a well-renowned physicist of the early twentieth century who also made significant contributions to the history of science.

In this post, I will discuss some of the new insights I have gained from this book. Unless stated otherwise, what follows reflects my understanding of Duhem’s perspective.

To understand how medieval physicists thought about the world, one has to begin with Aristotelian physics, also known as *Peripatetic Physics*. I will not attempt a complete account of it here (indeed, I do not yet fully understand it myself, and it requires separate investigation).

This framework of physics was eventually superseded by the modern physics of the sixteenth century, but not in the revolutionary manner often suggested by Enlightenment narratives. Rather, the transition occurred gradually, with the old theory being replaced step by step. The widespread notion of the “dark ages of science” is therefore a prejudice that persists to this day.

Notably, it was the influence of religion (in the monotheistic religions i.e. Christianity, Judaism and Islam) that in many cases drove developments toward modern physics. Certain Aristotelian assumptions in cosmology conflicted with central religious dogmas and were therefore challenged.

One such assumption was that the world is infinite both in space and in time, alongside the claim that an actual infinity of distinct objects is contradictory. This clashes with the religious doctrine of the immortal soul: if the world were infinite, an infinite number of souls would have accumulated over time, which would be impossible according to the second assumption.

Several responses to this dilemma emerged:

- **Stoics** denied the immortality of the soul altogether.
- **Neoplatonists** believed in the reincarnation of the soul: there is a finite number of souls that are reused over time.
- **Avicenna** held that the restriction on actual infinities applies only to entities with spatial extension and position. Souls, lacking spatial extent, would not be subject to this restriction. He nevertheless maintained the Aristotelian requirement that causal sequences must be finite, since there must be a first cause. This appears to conflict with the assumption of an infinite world, which Avicenna reconciled by distinguishing between *essential causes*, which cannot be infinite, and auxiliary or preparatory causes.  
  *Note (personal): This is particularly interesting, as it seems to anticipate a form of “memorylessness” that allows new causal sequences to begin spontaneously, an idea also found in Kant. This idea might have transpired from the scholastics through to Wolf, Baumgarten and eventually Kant.*
- **Averroes**, drawing on Avicenna, argued that after death all souls are united into a single “super-intelligence,” since numerical distinction applies only to objects in space.
- **al-Ghazālī** also follows up on Avicenna and argues that there are four ways in which infinities appear, two of which are exisiting and two do not exist. The first one is the "infinite motion of the heavens" (true), the second the "infinite number of souls" (true), infinity of space (false) and infinite series of causes and effects (false). The reason why the latter ones are not true infinities (at least what I personally take from the cited paragraph; Duhem does not comment on that) is that here the relation between the parts (objects in space and causal relations between things) is instantanious and ordered in a particular way. The "motion of heavens" is ordered but not simultanious and the infinite souls are simultanious but not ordered in some way. Later on, al-Ghazali gives up again on the idea of an eternal world when he turns to Islam.
    *Note (personal): Also here this reads a lot like the antinomies in Kant. Interestingly, Duhem claims later that al-Ghazali does not justify making distinctions between the two infinities although it is, in my opinion, clearly stated in the paragraph he cites.*

I recently continued reading Kojève’s *Analysis of Zeno’s Paradox* and ordered several books mentioned there in order to deepen my understanding of the history of science. What fascinates me most about this topic is that it opens up a modern perspective on ancient problems, illuminating both how these issues were viewed thousands of years ago and how we understand them today.

One particularly valuable book in this respect is *Medieval Cosmology* by Pierre Duhem. Duhem was a well-renowned physicist of the early twentieth century who also made significant contributions to the history of science.

In this post, I will discuss some of the new insights I have gained from this book. Unless stated otherwise, what follows reflects my understanding of Duhem’s perspective.

To understand how medieval physicists thought about the world, one has to begin with Aristotelian physics, also known as *Peripatetic Physics*. I will not attempt a complete account of it here (indeed, I do not yet fully understand it myself, and it requires separate investigation).

This framework of physics was eventually superseded by the modern physics of the sixteenth century, but not in the revolutionary manner often suggested by Enlightenment narratives. Rather, the transition occurred gradually, with the old theory being replaced step by step. The widespread notion of the “dark ages of science” is therefore a prejudice that persists to this day.

Notably, it was the influence of religion (i.e. the monotheistic religions Christianity, Judaism and Islam) that in many cases drove developments toward modern physics. Certain Aristotelian assumptions in cosmology conflicted with central religious dogmas and were therefore challenged.

One such assumption was that the world is infinite both in space and in time, alongside the claim that an actual infinity of distinct objects is contradictory. This clashes with the religious doctrine of the immortal soul: if the world were infinite, an infinite number of souls would have accumulated over time, which would be impossible according to the second assumption.

Several responses to this dilemma emerged:

- **Stoics** denied the immortality of the soul altogether.
- **Neoplatonists** believed in the reincarnation of the soul: there is a finite number of souls that are reused over time.
- **Avicenna** held that the restriction on actual infinities applies only to entities with spatial extension and position. Souls, lacking spatial extent, would not be subject to this restriction. He nevertheless maintained the Aristotelian requirement that causal sequences must be finite, since there must be a first cause. This appears to conflict with the assumption of an infinite world, which Avicenna reconciled by distinguishing between *essential causes*, which cannot be infinite, and auxiliary or preparatory causes.  
    *Note (personal):* This is particularly interesting, as it seems to anticipate a form of “memorylessness” that allows new causal sequences to begin spontaneously—an idea also found in Kant. This notion might be traceable from the scholastics through Wolff and Baumgarten, and eventually to Kant.

- **Averroes**, drawing on Avicenna, argued that after death all souls are united into a single “super-intelligence,” since numerical distinction applies only to objects in space.
- **al-Ghazālī** also builds on Avicenna and argues that there are four ways in which infinities appear, two of which exist and two of which do not. These are: the *infinite motion of the heavens* (true), the *infinite number of souls* (true), *infinite space* (false), and an *infinite series of causes and effects* (false).  
The reason the latter two do not constitute true infinities—at least as I understand the cited passage; Duhem himself does not comment on this—is that in these cases the relations between the parts (objects in space, or causal relations between things) are instantaneous and ordered in a specific way. By contrast, the motion of the heavens is ordered but not simultaneous, while the infinity of souls is simultaneous but not ordered in the same sense. Later, al-Ghazālī abandons the idea of an eternal world altogether when he turns toward Islam.
  *Note (personal): Here again, this strongly resembles Kant’s antinomies. Interestingly, Duhem later claims that al-Ghazālī does not justify his distinction between the two kinds of infinity, although, in my view, this justification is clearly present in the passage Duhem cites.*

A commentator on Aquinas *Metaphysics* brought up an interesting argument in regard of the reality of actual infinties: "There cannot exist an unspecified thing that would be indifferent specific determinations."
This sparked the idea for this article as it seems like what the author means here is that anything in nature which is real must be either of a particular determination or it's counter-determination.
This tempts to just define anything as real or potentially real which falls under the principle of excluded middle.
